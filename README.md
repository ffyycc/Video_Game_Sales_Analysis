# Video_Game_Sales_Analysis

## Background

In October 1958, the first video game was invented, which marks the start of an era. In the following years, video games have been constantly evolving and appear to be very popular especially in the 21th century. Now you can get millions of different kinds of video games on many platforms, and the players can always find a game that they definitely love. Given so many different kinds of video games, how can we determine which video games are popular all over the world? We decide to use the total global sales of video games as a way to determine the popularity of the game, and we want to find out what factors might influence the global sales of video games.

We downloaded our dataset from Kaggle.com and modified the dataset to fit our analysis. Our dataset contains 7 columns, which are video game name, global sales (in million), North America Sales (in million), Japan Sales(in million), publisher of the game, critic score of the game and user score of the
game, and our dataset contains 462 rows, which means that there are 462 different video games in the dataset. We only included video games from the four largest publishers, which are Nintendo, Microsoft Game Studios, Activision, and Ubisoft, to ensure each company has enough video games. We want to find out how the North America Sales, Japan Sales, publisher, critic score, and user score influence the global sales of video games.

## What We Do

All the members of our group are interested in video games, so we decide to find out what factors might influence the global sales of video games. We created a linear model with sales in North America, sales in Japan, publisher of the game, the critic score of the game as well as the user score of the game. Then we performed several statistical methods including linear regression, model selection, ANOVA test and other methods to help our analysis. After getting the result from the statistical methods, we found out that the user score does not have a large influence on our final linear regression model, and the sales in North America, sales in Japan, publisher of the game and critic score have significant influence on the global sales of video games. Moreover, the publishers might have significantly different impacts in North America and in Japan, which is also a key finding from our analysis.
